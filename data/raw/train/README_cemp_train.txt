CHEMDNER-patents CEMPD subtask training text data (Version 8th March 2015)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the training set text for the CHEMDNER-patents CEMP subtask.

1) chemdner_patents_train_text.txt : training set

This file contains plain-text, UTF8-encoded Patent abstracts in a 
tab-separated format with the following three columns:

1- Patent identifier
2- Title of the patent
3- Abstract of the patent

In total 7000 abstracts are provided in this sample set (7000 titles and 7000 abstracts)

2) chemdner_cemp_gold_standard_train.tsv

For the CEMP (chemical entity mention in patents) task we distribute manually tagged patents (title and abstracts) with 
structure-associated chemical entity mentions (SACEMs). The CEMP annotations consist of tab-separated fields containing:

1- Patent identifier
2- Type of text from which the annotation was derived (T: Title, A: Abstract)
3- Start offset
4- End offset
5- Text string of the entity mention
6- Type of chemical entity mention (ABBREVIATION,FAMILY,FORMULA,IDENTIFIERS,MULTIPLE,SYSTEMATIC,TRIVIAL)


3) chemdner_cemp_gold_standard_train_eval.tsv

Gold standard evaluation format to be used for assessment with the biocreative evaluation script.

It consists of tab-separated columns containing:

1- Patent identifier
2- Offset string consisting in a triplet joined by the ':' character. You have to provide the text type (T: Title, A:Abstract), the start offset and the end offset.


4) cemp_patent_guidelines_v1.pdf

Annotation guidelines used for preparing the chemical mention annotations. Important: It contains
several changes with respect to the guidelines used for the CHEMDNER task at Biocreative IV (most of those changes are highlighted in the document).


5) CEMP task prediction format

For the CEMP task we will only request the prediction of the chemical mention offsets following
a similar stetting as done for the BioCreative IV CHEMDNER task on PubMed abstracts. Given a set
of patent abstracts, the participants have to return the start and end indices corresponding to 
all the chemical entities mentioned in this document. 

It consists of tab-separated columns containing:

1- Patent identifier
2- Offset string consisting in a triplet joined by the ':' character. You have to provide the text type (T: Title, A:Abstract), the start offset and the end offset.
3- The rank of the chemical entity returned for this document
4- A confidence score
5- The string of the chemical entity mention

An example illustrating the prediction format is shown below:

WO2009026621A1	A:12:24	1	0.99	paliperidone
WO2011115938A1	T:0:17	1	0.99	Spiro-tetracyclic
WO2011115687A2	A:0:12	1	0.99	SP-B
WO2011115687A2	T:0:22	2	0.98989	Alkylated
WO2011115687A2	A:104:117	3	0.98978	SP-B
US20050101595	A:0:13	1	0.99	Aminothiazole
US20050101595	A:60:67	2	0.98989	2-amino
US20050101595	T:0:50	3	0.98978	N-containing
US20050101595	A:29:52	4	0.98967	N-containing
WO2010147138A1	A:252:262	1	0.99	nucleotide
WO2010147138A1	A:363:373	2	0.98989	amino
WO2010147138A1	A:92:102	3	0.98978	fatty
CN103087254A	A:196:218	1	0.99	stearyl


The evaluation will be done using the BioCreative Evaluation script available at:

http://www.biocreative.org/resources/biocreative-ii5/evaluation-library/

In this case the INT - article classification format option will be used.

Example command:
 bc-evaluate --INT team_cemp_prediction.tsv chemdner_cemp_gold_standard_train_eval.tsv > team_cemp_prediction.eval


where --INT corresponds to the required evaluation option
team_cemp_prediction.tsv 			corresponds to the prediction file
chemdner_cemp_gold_standard_train_eval.tsv 	corresponds to the evaluation file


If you have problems with the required prediction format use bc-evaluate with the flag --debug to find out what is wrong.
